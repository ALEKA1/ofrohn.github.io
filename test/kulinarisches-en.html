<h1>Culinary matters</h1>
<p>The province of Alicante offers from the mountains of the interior, the great beaches on the coast, to traces of many a great ancient civilisation a large diversity and also a great climate. This diversity is mirrored in the historic and gastronomic patrimony of the region.</p>

<p>Since the times of the Phoenicians, Romans and Muslims the Costa Blanca has had an interesting development behind it, that has enriched the art of cooking based on rice, sea food and a great selection of spices and meats. Marked by the influence and the traditions of the Mediterranean space, eating developed into something to cherish and to learn, because it teaches you how to achieve much with a little and create something definitive without a rigid scheme of ingredients.</p>

<p>Let's talk about one of the basic elements of the alicantine cuisine: „Salsa Aioli“. this mixture of olive oil and garlic is the bae for many dishes from Alicante, normally in conjunction with sea food. This sauce has its origin in the Arabic world and is an eternal protagonist of the culinary culture of Italy, France and many other countries in Europe and Africa.</p>

<h3>Typical from Alicante</h3>

<img src="images/naranjas.jpg">

In the sector of fruits and vegetables the Orange is without a doubt the quintessence of Alicante. Despite being harvested in October and throughout the winter, it is available almost all through the year.</p>

<p>Most of the typical dishes in Alicante are prepared with rice. Uncontested star is the famous Paella, made from rice, chicken, rabbit, green and white beans.</p>

<p>Other traditional dishes are „Arroz al horno“ (baked rice), „Arroz a banda“ (rice with see food), „Arroz negro“ (rice with squid), „Arròs amb fesols i naps“, a juicy rice with beans and turnips, and then we have the „Fideuá“, with glass noodles and sea food, seasoned with saffron, which is also a typical receipe in Valencia. The Fideuá is one of those dishes you really have to try when you are visiting Alicante.<p>

<p>As in other Spanish regions, the so called „Tapas“ meet with much agreement. Patatas Bravas, grilled squid, mussels, anchovies in vinegar and Cod crocquettes are just a few of them, the  ideal companions for a cold beer or a fresh Sangria!</p>

<p>Worth mentioning is also the wine culture, because Alicante produces many grapes and wines celebrated world wide. Some of the gapes produced in Alicante are: Garnacha, Monastrell, Tempranillo, Bobal, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir and Syrah, all red variants. White ones are Muscat de Alexandria, Planta Fina, Merseguera, Chardonnay, Verdil, Sauvignon Blanc, Airén and Macabeo.</p>

<h3>Turrón from Jijona</h3>
<img src="images/turron.jpg">

<p>Some of the traditional sweets of Alicante show a strong Arabic influence, therefore the use of almonds and honey is widespread. Among the favourite desserts in Alicante are "almojabanes", "rosetones", "Arrop i tallaetes i Arnadí" (Mellon, sweet potato and sweet almonds). The most beloved of all desserts, especially for Christmas, is the Turron from almonds and sugar. Bon appetit!</p>

<h2>Some Typical Recipes</h2>
