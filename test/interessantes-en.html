<h3>Attractions and Fiestas on the Costa Blanca</h3>
<p>If you spend your holiday in the Costa Blanca, you should not miss a visit to <b>Torrevieja</b>. The city has 105,000 registered inhabitants, but in the summer months that number can at times increase to about 500,000. In the last few years Torrevieja experienced a boom and developed into a mundane metropolis with international flair. Many pedestrian zones were decorated with palm trees. In the boutiques and little shops you can find many extravagant things.</p>

<p>For friends of the nature a tour by glass bottom ship to the island of <b>Tarbarca</b> is recommended. The small island for relaxation, without cars! Directly at the fishing port you can buy a whole bag of fresh fish for a few Euros early in the morning.</p>

<p>A walk on the harbour dike of Torrevieja with a length of 1.8 km can leave lasting impressions and also offers interesting views for photos. In the evening a walk on the maritime promenade is recommended, half of Torrevieja is there, see and be seen is the motto. There are also quiet a few sand artists who display their works, also inviting a photo or two.</p>
